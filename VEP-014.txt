New Term: spatial-profile
Action: Addition
Label: Spatial Profile
Description: An observable obtained along a one-dimensional spatial path.
Relationships: narrower than #spatially-resolved-dataset
Used-in: TBD

Rationale:
Single dish radio observations where a cross-shaped scan is executed on
a target object are commonly performed for flux measurements or pointing
correction calculations, and are best described as a spatial profile.
Typically, the spatial length of each arm of the cross is larger than
the spatial resolution to allow for a proper background subtraction.
Other radio observations (usually performed at high frequency) that can be described as spatial profiles
are elevation scans on the empty sky executed to calculate opacity
corrections.
Another case for spatial-profile would be when a planetary probe takes
measurements along its flight path.

Such observational data need a dedicated term for their discovery
because they have calibration, processing and analysis modes rather
distinct from other data product types.
However, further differentiation among various types of profiles may be considered if
additional use cases are formulated.

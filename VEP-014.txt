New Term: spatial-profile
Action: Addition
Label: Spatial Profile
Description: An observable obtained along a one-dimensional spatial path.
Relationships: narrower than #spatially-resolved-dataset
Used-in: TBD

Rationale:
Spatial profiles are commonly used in single-dish radio observations,
where a cross of about five beams centered on the target object is
scanned for computing flux backgrounds or pointing
corrections.  Other profiles used in radio astronomy scan over elevation
to create opacity corrections.

Another case for spatial-profile would be when a planetary probe takes
measurements along its flight path.  Both sorts of data products clearly
need discovery modes of their own because they have analysis modes
rather distinct from other data product types.  Whether the different
sorts of profiles need further separation remains to be seen in usage.

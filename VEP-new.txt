New Term: response-function
Action: Addition
Label: Response Function
Description: A mapping between a physical quantity and an observable
	quantity as for instance, the response of a CCD in the focal plane of
	an instrument to the flux from a point source.
Relationships:
Used-in: As a parent of #psf

New Term: psf
Action: Addition
Label: Point Spread Function
Description: The distribution of detected particles emitted by a point
	source for a given observation configuration.
Relationships: narrower than response-function
Used-in: Try
	select top 20 * from ivoa.ObsCore where dataproduct_type='psf'
  on the TAP service at <https://cda.cfa.harvard.edu/csc2tap>.

New Term: arf
Action: Addition
Label: Ancillary Response File
Description:  A 2D array giving for each pixel the effective area times
	the quantum efficiency resulting from the combined
	telescope/filter/detector areas averaged over the observation time.
	This is generally dependent on the energies of the messenger particles
	used.
Relationships: narrower than response-function
Used-in: Try
	select top 20 * from ivoa.ObsCore where dataproduct_type='arf'
  on the TAP service at <https://cda.cfa.harvard.edu/csc2tap>.

Rationale:
	#response-function-s need to be labelled as products in obscore
	tables to make them discoverable independently of any particular
	observation.  For instance, Chandra users have extracted a few sources
	from the catalogue and now want to locate PSFs for the observations
	that went into these sources.  They will be able to do that by
	constraining dataproduct_type to psf and giving further constraints on
	space, time, or energy.

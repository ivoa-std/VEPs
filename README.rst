The IVOA manages their Vocabulary Enhancement Proposals (VEP) through this
repository.  See `Vocabularies 2, Section 5.2.1`_ for what a VEP ist and
why you may want to create one.

Before starting a new VEP, it is probably a good idea to discuss your idea
on the `IVOA semantics mailing list`_.  Once you are ready to enter the
formal VEP process, please follow `Appendix C.1`_ for Vocabularies in
the VO.

VEPs can also be managed outside of github if authors have privacy
(or other) concerns.  Contact the chairs of the IVOA `Semantics WG`_ for more
information.

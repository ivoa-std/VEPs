Description: This resource used the related resource as a source of information.

Used-in: The registry record ivo://edu.gavo.org/hd/gavo_addpms (and most
  other IVOA document records; cf.

Rationale: This term is proposed to replace the deprecated term "related-to"
  in the registry relationships. In VizieR, "related-to" refers VO resources
  which are linked by their biliographic references.

  For instance, a VizieR catalogue V is attached to a bibliographic reference.
  This article includes in the section "References" citations to other
  articles A1, A2, ... some of them have a VizieR catalogue V1,V2,...
  The proposed relation makes the relation between V and V1,V2,...

  "References"  is a term used in DataCite schema.

New Term: ExportRequested
Action: Addition
Label: Export Requested
Description: The date the publisher has requested non-VO bibliographic
	services to pick up and index the metadata of the resource as per
	the BibVO note.
Relationships:
Used-in: ivo://org.gavo.dc/gaia/s3/pub (or try
	select ivoid from rr.res_date where value_role='exportrequested'
	on your favourite RegTAP service)

Rationale:
	Many resources in the VO Registry should not really be carried in
	bibliographic services like the ADS; the proper way to credit them is
	to cite the publications they accompany.  However, where resources do
	not clearly belong to a (unique) publication, it may be a good idea to
	encourage researchers to cite the VO resource itself, which means it
	should be represented in bibliographic services.  Operators can
	request that representation by obtaining a DOI for their VO resource
	and setting a date with this role in the VO Registry.  See
	https://ivoa.net/documents/Notes/BibVO/ for more information.
